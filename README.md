<i>Ab initio</i> design of microbial communities from large-scale seed pools using deep learning and rapid optimization


## Abstract
----
Many biotechnological applications rely on microbial communities. Designing optimal microbial communities from seed pools can be guided by genomic information. However, the cost of designing communities increases exponentially as the size of the seed pool grows. Furthermore, assembled microbial communities often suffer from instability. Here, we introduce eBiota, a tool for ab initio designing microbial communities from a pool of 21,514 strains. eBiota uses CoreBFS, a graph-based search method, and ProdFBA, an extension of classical flux balance analysis, to rapidly identify microbial communities optimized for a target function. The communities are potentially stable by design thanks to DeepCooc, a deep learning algorithm that recognizes co-occurrence patterns from 23,323 samples across environments. We demonstrate the capabilities of eBiota using public microbial communities, ranging from single strain to six members. Our in vitro culture experiments, involving 94 strains, further validate eBiotaâ€™s ability by selecting species that prevent pathogen growth and by conducting large microbial communities. Finally, eBiota offers scalable community predictions for a broad range of biotechnological applications.
